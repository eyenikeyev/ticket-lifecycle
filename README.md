<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>
<h3>Intake</h3>

<p>
  <ul>
<p>
From the End Users side (Karen Smith), they create a ticket through ostTickets local host site and fill their information. Select a Help Topic.

</p>
<p>
The End User then writes ticket through the Issue Summary and adds a subject and details of the ticket much similiar to writing an email. 
</p>
In this example, Karen creates the ticket under the Help Topic of a Business Critical Outage, explaining the mobile baking operation is suffering a 404 error

</p>
<p>
Karen then creates the ticket and is sent to Agent Jane Doe (which we've set as Supreme Admin is able too see all incoming tickets in the configuration tutorial) who views it from the local help desk login
<p>
Priorities have not been set for other incoming tickets such as ticket #788058 where end user Ken is requesting an upgrade to Adobe Reader. SLA plans need to be set for these tickets hence why they are all under the priority state of "Normal"

</ul>
</p>

<h3>Assignment & Communication</h3>

<p>
  <ul>
<br />

<p>
The Business Critical Outage ticket by Karen numbered #726296 is assigned to the Agent Jane Doe. From Jane's perspective, this is how the ticket first looks. The Agent is able to message the End User through the Ticket Thread located in the bottom of the ticket page
